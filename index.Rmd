# The versioning system `git`

<br>
<br>

- `git` is a very popular choice for **software development**.

--

- Tailored for tracking changes in software files.

--

- But, also useful with anything that is text-based (like analysis scripts, papers, dissertations, ...).

---

# What can `git` do for you?

<br>
<br>


- Keep track of **new or deleted files** in a project.

- Keep track of **changes to individual files** in a project.

  - Done on a line-by-line basis.

- Roll **back to a previous version** of the project or files.

- Make **back-ups of** your files.

# Let's try it!

---

# But what about data?

<br>
<br>

- `git` is not great with non-text data.

--

- Non-text data have no "lines" so `git` tracks changes to the entire file (rather than portions of it).

--

- This is very inefficient.

---

# Enter `dvc`

<br>
<br>

- `dvc` works on top of `git` to make data versioning easier and efficient.

--

- It has many features that can be used for many different purposes.

--

- You can use it as a back-up system as well!

# Summary

<br>
<br>

- Versioning your projects allows you to take "screenshots" of the current state of your files.

- `git` and `dvc` are a great combo for data versioning.

- Versioning with `git` and `dvc` is safe (if you make a mistake, you can always go back) and flexible.

- There's much more that you can do! (Branching, collaboration, remote storage, reproduce pipelines, ...)
