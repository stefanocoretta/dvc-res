## Getting to know git

Open your terminal and type the following command:

```{bash}
# I am a comment! You don't need to type me :)

# The following commands create a new folder called "dvctest"
# and navigates into that folder.

mkdir dvctest
cd dvctest
```

Now create a text file with your preferred text editor, write a short sentence and save the file in the `dvctest/` folder with the name `hello.txt`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go back to your terminal and type:

```{bash}
ls
```

This will list the files in the current folder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now type the following command to initialise a git repository:

```{bash}
git init

# Check it worked with git status
git status
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's make out first commit.

```{bash}
# This stages all changes
git add .

# Let's check it worked
git status

# Now we can commit the changes
git commit -m "my first commit"

# and check
git status
```

## Track changes with git

Write a new line in `hello.txt` and save the file. Then check what changed in the file:

```{bash}
git status
git diff hello.txt
```

And let's commit the changes:

```{bash}
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "add text line"
```

You can check the history of commits like so:

```{bash}
git log
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now add another line in `hello.txt` and create a new file called `heya.txt`. Then:

```{bash}
git status

# Let's add and commit only the changes in hello.txt
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "add another text line"

git status

git add heya.txt
git commit -m "add new file"

git log
```

## What about data?

Initialise a dvc repository in your `dvctest/` folder.

```{bash}
dvc init

dvc status
# Looks familiar?
```

Now let's create a folder called `data` in our `dvctest/` folder and add two or three images of your choice (or anything else, like an audio file, a video, a database...).

```{bash}
# We are using the mkdir command to create a new folder but of course
# you can just create one from the Finder/Explorer
mkdir data

# Now copy a few files into the data/ folder, then:

git status
```

Let's start tracking the `data/` folder with dvc.

```{bash}
dvc add data
# Again, does it look familiar?

dvc status
git status
```

What happened?

---

Let's stage and commit the `data.dvc` file.

```{bash}
git add .
git commit -m "track data with dvc"
```
