## Getting to know git

Open your terminal and type the following command:

```{bash}
# I am a comment! You don't need to type me :)

# The following commands create a new folder called "dvctest"
# and navigates into that folder.

mkdir dvctest
cd dvctest
```

Now create a text file with your preferred text editor, write a short sentence and save the file in the `dvctest/` folder with the name `hello.txt`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go back to your terminal and type:

```{bash}
ls
```

This will list the files in the current folder.

Now type the following command to initialise a git repository:

```{bash}
git init

# Check it worked with git status
git status
```
